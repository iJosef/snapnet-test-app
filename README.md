## Technology Stack

  - [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
  - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

## Functionalities
* Create and run the migration files and populate tables with few data for NPC database.
* Build a Laravel/Phplogin, where admin can register new citizen records and a simple blade  view  with  a  search  input  and  submit  button  that  displays  list  of  citizens  (id, name, gender) on a table. On clicking on any of the citizenâ€™s name it displays citizen full record.
* Build a Laravel/Php.jsREST API with Sanctum Authentication or any LaravelREST API package  of  your  choice  with  an  authentication  mechanism,  to  enable  third-party applications fetch and consume those citizen records using API endpoints. You can test will Postman.
